# Terrarium

Terrarium is an accessibility-focused tModLoader mod for Terraria. The first development area is menu reading for blind and low-vision players.

## Repository Layout

- `Mods/Terrarium/` contains the tracked tModLoader mod.
- `Tools/build.ps1` compiles or packages the mod using the local tModLoader installation.
- `docs/decompilation/` contains tracked navigation maps for local decompiled references.
- `Terraria Decompiled/` and `TModLoader Decompiled/` are local, read-only references excluded from Git.

## Build

Install tModLoader through Steam, then compile and package the mod with:

```powershell
.\Tools\build.ps1
```

Set `TML_INSTALL_PATH` if tModLoader is not in its standard Steam location.

## Local References

The decompiled source trees are intentionally untracked and must not be published. Start source investigations with [the tModLoader map](docs/decompilation/decompiled-tmodloader-map.md) or [the Terraria map](docs/decompilation/decompiled-terraria-map.md), then narrow searches with `rg`.
